=== Project Description ===
===========================

The project is a simple calculator that allows you to do basic mathematics. It is nothing extraordinary, however, I created it solely for the purpose of gaining experience and improving upon my knowledge.

Some of the challenges I faced creating this project was the limitation (from my experience) that Tkinter has. Such as not being able to track real-time input from the user, which doesn't allow me to limit what the user can enter into the entry window, I overcame this by just passing the user entry text through some conditional statements when you click the equal button, which either carries on with the program if it is valid input that is intended (This is text that stays in the realm of mathematics. The program will throw an error into the entry window if you enter any text that contains ASCII characters or symbols other than those used in basic mathematics.)

I look to improve upon the UI to make it look neater and less rigid and plain. 


==================
=== How to use ===
==================

There are 3 ways to use this program:

- (RECOMMENDED) You can immediately start typing with your keyboard (or Numpad) for numbers and operators. You can use backspace or delete to clear and enter to evaluate the expression.
- You can use your mouse to click the numbers, operators, and functions.
- You can click into the window and type whatever you would like, just note that the program will throw an error if you enter anything other than valid mathematical operators and numbers, and yes this includes code. But you're more than welcome to try to break the program.
